Description: Gaussian process regression models, a.k.a. Kriging models, are
    applied to global multi-objective optimization of black-box functions.
    Multi-objective Expected Improvement and Step-wise Uncertainty Reduction
    sequential infill criteria are available. A quantification of uncertainty
    on Pareto fronts is provided using conditional simulations.
